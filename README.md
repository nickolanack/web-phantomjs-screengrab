# web-phantomjs-screengrab
Just a simple tool that checks that my websites are running and takes screenshots of the sites

Currently I am trying to create a simple tool that will monitor all of my apache virtual hosts, by requesting data from the url, and rendering an image of the page using phantomjs. I am going to use this tool to create a simple web page that displays all the sites as a grid of snapshots (example/index.php), and have the tool check each site every few minutes.
